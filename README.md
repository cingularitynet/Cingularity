## Cingularity <> Modelo_Decentralized computation farm
This is the very first step of Cingularity's vision of decentralized GPU computation world. 
What's included:
1. Two types of server based renderer(Vray and Arnold, Corona renderer is next) integration.
2. Infrastructure of serving 3D objects to distributed nodes. 
3. Conversion and integration between Modelo's 3D output to the input for different renderers.
